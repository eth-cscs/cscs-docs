    Introduction

    This page is a cut and paste of some of Todi's old documentation, which we can turn into a template.

## Cluster Specification
### Hardware
Clariden consists of ~1200 [Grace-Hopper nodes][ref-alps-gh200-node]. Most nodes are in the [`normal` slurm partition][ref-slurm-partition-normal], while a few nodes are in the [`debug` partition][ref-slurm-partition-debug].
The nodes are interconnected with the [slingshot high speed network][ref-alps-slingshot-network].

As usual the login nodes have direct internet connections, while the compute nodes use a [proxy server][ref-network-proxy-server] to access the internet.
!!! todo
    Document proxy and the implications (normally transparent, but git needs modifications

### File systems and storage
The scratch filesystem is hosted on [IOPStore][ref-storage-iopstor], but also the capacity storage [Capstor][ref-storage-capstor] is mounted at `/capstor/scratch/cscs`.
The variables `STORE` and `PROJECT` are not set on Clariden.

The home directory is hosted on [VAST][ref-storage-vast]. As usual, an overview of your quota on the different filesystems can be obtained by the `quota` command.

## Getting started
### Connect to Clariden
You can connect to Clariden via [ssh][ref-ssh-config], ensuring that the file `~/.ssh/config` has these settings (replace `cscsusername` with your username).

```title="$HOME/.ssh/config"
Host ela
    HostName ela.cscs.ch
    User cscsusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key

Host clariden
    HostName clariden.alps.cscs.ch
    ProxyJump ela
    User cscsusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```
You can then use `ssh clariden` to login to Clariden.

## Running Jobs on Clariden

Clariden uses [SLURM][slurm] as the workload manager, which is used to launch and monitor distributed workloads, such as training runs.

See detailed instructions on how to run jobs on the [Grace-Hopper nodes][ref-slurm-gh200].

## Storage

!!! todo
    describe the file systems that are attached, and where.

    This is where `$SCRATCH`, `$PROJECT` etc are defined for this cluster.

    Refer to the specific file systems that these map onto (capstor, iopstor, waldur), and link to the storage docs for these.

    Also discuss any specific storage policies. You might want to discuss storage policies for MLp one level up, in the [MLp docs][ref-platform-mlp].

## Calendar and key events

The system is updated every Tuesday, between 9 am and 12 pm.

    a calendar widget would be useful, particularly if we can have a central calendar, and a way to filter events for specific instances

## Change log

!!! change "special text boxes for updates"
    they can be opened and closed.

!!! change "2024-10-15 reservation `daint` available again"
    The reservation daint  is available again exclusively for Daint users that need to run their benchmarks for submitting their proposals, additionally to the debug  partition and free nodes.
    Please add the Slurm option --reservation=daint to your batch script if you want to use it

??? change "2024-10-07 New compute node image deployed"
    New compute node image deployed to fix the issue with GPU-aware MPI.

    Max job time limit is decreased from 12 hours to 6 hours

??? change "2024-09-18 Daint users"
    In order to complete the preparatory work necessary to deliver Alps in production, as of September 18 2024 the vCluster Daint on Alps will no longer be accessible until further notice: the early access will still be granted on TÃ¶di using the Slurm reservation option `--reservation=daint`
