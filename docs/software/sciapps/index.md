# Scientific Applications

CSCS provides and supports a selection of scientific applications on the computing systems: we usually build community codes that are adopted by several users on our systems.

Please have a look at the individual application page on the menu to find out how to run in a production environment.

CSCS staff can also help users with performance analysis to optimise their workflow in production.
