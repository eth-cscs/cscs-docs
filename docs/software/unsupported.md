# Unsupported Software

There are some software packages that CSCS can't or won't provide directly for users, often for licensing reasons.

## Gaussian

The electronic structure modeling code [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) has license terms that prohibit installing and using it on CSCS systems under any circumstances.

## Matlab

CSCS does not have a license to provide [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to users on Alps.

Users or groups with valid licenses can install Matlab themselves.
Please ensure that you install the software in a location where only members of your group who are allowed to use Matlab can access it.
