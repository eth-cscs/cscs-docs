# Unsupported Software

This page documents frequently-requested applications that CSCS won't provide pre-built on Alps as [supported software][ref-support-apps].

!!! danger "License terms"
    Often it is impossible or difficult to provide software for licensing reasons.
    If users are asked to install licensed software because CSCS can't, it is the responsibility of users to ensure that the software is only available to them personally, or to [members of their group][ref-guides-storage-sharing] who are also permitted by the license to access the software.

## Gaussian

The electronic structure modeling code [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) has license terms that prohibit installing and using it on CSCS systems under any circumstances.

## Matlab

CSCS does not have a license to provide [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to users on Alps.
Users or groups with valid licenses can install Matlab themselves as [user software][ref-support-user-apps].
