## Debugging

Parallel debugging tools designed for parallel and distributed applications can help you diagnose issues and verify the correctness of your code - whether you are using MPI, OpenMP, or accelerated programming models.

Learning to debug a code effectively will not only help you quickly resolve issues but also build a deeper understanding of how your code interacts with the underlying hardware.
In this section we introduce the various debugging tools available at CSCS.

## Performance Analysis

Performance analysis tools are essential to gain insight into how an application leverages a distributed system with CPUs and GPUs and should be integrated to the development and optimization workflow of the application.
This ensures that computational resources are utilized to their fullest potential.

Learning to analyze the performance of an applications effectively is crucial to build a deeper understanding of how your code interacts with the underlying hardware.
In this section we introduce the various performance analysis solutions available at CSCS.
