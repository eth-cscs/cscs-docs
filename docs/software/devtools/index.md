# Debugging and Performance Analysis tools

Debugging and Performance Analysis tools can assist users in developing and
optimizing scientific parallel applications, especially in a high-performance
computing (HPC) environment. Efficient tools can significantly improve
workflows and save valuable computational resources.

* [Debugging][ref-software-devtools-debug]:
Parallel debugging tools designed for parallel and distributed applications can
help you diagnose issues and verify the correctness of your code - whether you
are using MPI, OpenMP, or accelerated programming models.

* [Performance Analysis][ref-software-devtools-perf]:
Performance analysis tools are essential to gain insight into how an
application leverages a distributed system with CPUs and GPUs and should be
integrated to the development and optimization workflow of the application.
This ensures that computational resources are utilized to their fullest
potential.
