# Debugging tools

Learning to debug a code effectively will not only help you quickly
resolve issues but also build a deeper understanding of how your code
interacts with the underlying hardware. In this section we introduce
the various debugging tools available at CSCS. If you have issues or
questions about debugging tools, please do not hesitate to contact us on
[support.cscs.ch](https://support.cscs.ch).
