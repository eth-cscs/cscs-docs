## Versioning and labeling

Uenv images have a **label** of the following form:

```
name/version:tag@system%uarch
```

for example:

```
prgenv-gnu/24.11:v2@todi%gh200
```

### uenv name

The name of the uenv. In this case `prgenv-gnu`.

### uenv version

The version of the uenv.

The format of `version` depends on the specific uenv.
Often they use the `yy.mm` format, though they may also use the version of the software being packaged.
For example the [`namd/3.0`][ref-uenv-namd] uenv packages version 3.0 of the popular [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) simulation tool.

### uenv tag

Used to differentiate between _releases_ of a versioned uenv.
Some examples of tags include:

* `rc1`, `rc2`: release candidates;
* `v1`: a first release typically made after some release candidates;
* `v2`: a second release, that fixes issues in `v1`

### uenv system

The name of the [Alps cluster][ref-alps-clusters] for which the uenv was built.

[](){#ref-uenv-label-uarch}
### uenv uarch

The node type (microarchitecture) that the uenv is built for.

| uarch                      | CPU | GPU | comment |
| ----- | --- | --- | ------ |
|[gh200][ref-alps-gh200-node]| 4 72-core NVIDIA Grace (`aarch64`) | 4 NVIDIA H100 GPUs | |
|[zen2][ref-alps-zen2-node]  | 2 64-core AMD Rome (`zen2`)        | - | used in Eiger|
|[a100][ref-alps-a100-node]  | 1 64-core AMD Milan (`zen3`)       | 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs | |
|[mi200][ref-alps-mi200-node]| 1 64-core AMD Milan (`zen3`)       | 4 AMD Mi250x GPUs  | |
|[mi300][ref-alps-mi300-node]| 4 24-core AMD Genoa (`zen4`)       | 4 AMD Mi300 GPUs  | |
| zen3                       | 2 64-core AMD Milan (`zen3`)       | - | only in MCH system |

## Registries

The following naming scheme is employed in the OCI container registry for uenv images:

```text
namespace/system/uarch/name/version:tag
```

Where the fields `system`, `uarch`, `name`, `version` and `tag` are defined above.

The `namespace` is one of:

* `build`: where the CI/CD pipeline pushes uenv images.
* `deploy`: where uenv images are copied by CSCS staff when they are officially provided to users.
* `service`: where the uenv [build service][ref-uenv-build] pushes images.

!!! info "JFrog uenv registry"
    The OCI container registry used to host uenv is on JFrog, and can be browsed at [jfrog.svc.cscs.ch/artifactory/uenv/](https://jfrog.svc.cscs.ch/artifactory/uenv/) (you may have to log in with CSCS credentials from the a VPN/CSCS network).

    The address of individual uenv images is of the form
    ```
    https://jfrog.svc.cscs.ch/uenv/namespace/system/uarch/name/version:tag
    ```
    For example:
    ```
    https://jfrog.svc.cscs.ch/uenv/deploy/eiger/zen2/cp2k:2024.1
    ```

## uenv recipes and definitions

The uenv recipes are maintained in a public GitHub repository: [eth-cscs/alps-uenv](https://github.com/eth-cscs/alps-uenv).

The recipes for each uenv version are stored in the `recipes` subdirectory. 
Specific uenv recipes are stored in `recipes/name/version/uarch/`.

The `cluster` is specified when building and deploying the uenv, while the `tag` is specified when deploying the uenv.

## uenv deployment

### Deployment rules

A recipe can be built for deployment on different clusters, and for multiple targets.
For example:

* A multicore recipe could be built for `zen2` or `zen3` nodes
* A GROMACS recipe that is tuned for A100 GPUs can be built and deployed on any vCluster supporting the A100 architecture

However, it is not desirable to build every recipe on every possible target system.
For example:

* An ICON development environment would only be deployed on the weather and climate platform
* A GROMACS recipe would not be deployed on the weather and climate platform
* Development builds only need to run on test and staging clusters

A YAML file `config.yaml` is maintained in the [github.com/eth-cscs/alps-uenv](https://github.com/eth-cscs/alps-uenv/blob/main/config.yaml) repository that maps
recipes to deployed versions on microarchitectures.

### Permissions

!!! note "For CSCS staff"
    This information applies only to CSCS staff.

Deployment and deletion of uenv requires elevated permissions.
Before you can modify the uenv registry, you need to set up credentials.

* Your CSCS username needs to be added to the `uenv-admin` group on JFrog, and
* you need to generate a new token for the [JFrog](https://jfrog.svc.cscs.ch) registry.

Once you have the token, you can save it in a file.

!!! danger

    Save the token file somwhere safe, for example in `~/.ssh/jfrog-token`.


The token file can be passed to the `uenv` command line tool using the `--token` option.

```bash
uenv image copy --token=${HOME}/.ssh/jfrog-token <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>
```

### Deploying a uenv

!!! note "For CSCS staff"
    This information applies only to CSCS staff.

The CI/CD pipeline for [eth-cscs/alps-uenv](https://github.com/eth-cscs/alps-uenv) pushes images to the JFrog uenv registry in the `build::` namespace.

Deploying a uenv copies the uenv image from the `build::` namespace to the `deploy::` namespace. The Squashfs image itself is not copied;
a new tag for the uenv is created in the `deploy::` namespace.

The deployment is performed using the `uenv` command line tool, as demonstrated below:

```bash
uenv image copy build::<SOURCE> deploy::<DESTINATION> # (1)!
```

1. `<DESTINATION>` must be fully qualified.

!!! example "Deploy using image ID"
    
    Deploy a uenv from `build::` using the ID of the image:

    ```bash
    uenv image copy build::d2afc254383cef20 deploy::prgenv-nvfortran/24.11:v1@daint%gh200
    ```

!!! example "Deploy using qualified name"

    Deploy a uenv using the qualified name:

    ```
    uenv image copy build::quantumespresso/v7.4:1653244229 deploy::quantumespresso/v7.4:v1@daint%gh200
    ```

    !!! note 

        The build image uses the CI/CD pipeline ID as the tag. You will need to choose an appropriate tag.

!!! example "Deploy a uenv from one cluster to another"

    You can also deploy a uenv from one vCluster to another.
    For example, if the `uenv` for `prgenv-gnu` has been deployed on `daint`,
    to make it available on `santis`, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    uenv image copy deploy::prgenv-gnu/24.11:v1@daint%gh200 deploy::prgenv-gny/24.11@santis%gh200
    ```

### Removing a uenv

To remove a uenv, you can use the `uenv` command line tool:

```bash
uenv image delete --token=${HOME}/.ssh/jfrog-token deploy::<IMAGE>
```

!!! danger

    Removing a uenv is disruptive.
    Please have a look at out [uenv removal policy][ref-uenv-removal] for more information.

## Source code access

Some source artifacts are stored in JFrog, including:

* source code for software that can't be downloaded directly from the internet directly;
* and tar balls for custom software.

These artifacts are stored in a JFrog "generic repository" [uenv-sources].

Each software package has a sub-directory and all image paths are lower case (e.g. `uenv-sources/namd`).

By default, all packages in [uenv-sources]  are anonymous read access
to enable users to build uenv on vClusters without configuring access tokens.
However,

* access to some packages is restricted by applying access rules to the package path
* e.g. access to `uenv-sources/vasp` is restricted to members of the vasp6 group

Permissions to access restricted resources is set on a per-pipeline basis

* For example, only the `alps-uenv` pipeline has access to the VASP source code, while the [`uenv build`][ref-uenv-build] pipeline does not.

| Package | Access | Path | Notes | Contact |
|---------|--------|------|-------| ------- |
| `cray-mpich` | anonymous | `uenv-sources/cray-mpich` | `cray-mpich`, `cray-gtl`, `cray-pals`, `cray-mpi` | Simon Pintarelli, Benjamin Cumming|
| `namd` | `uenv-sources-csstaff` | `uenv-sources/namd` | NAMD requires an account to download the source code | Rocco Meli |
| `vasp` | `vasp6`, `cscs-uenv-admin` | `uenv-sources/vasp` | VASP requires a paid license to access source | Simon Frasch |
| `vmd` | `uenv-sources-csstaff` | `uenv-sources/vmd` | VMD requires an account to download the source code | Alberto Invernizzi |
