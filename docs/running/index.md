# Running Jobs

[Slurm][ref-slurm] is used on CSCS systems to schedule jobs.
For scheduling many small jobs (1 core or short time) we recommend [HyperQueue][ref-hyperqueue].
The [job report tool][ref-jobreport] can be used in Slurm jobs to collect reports on how well an application uses the system.
