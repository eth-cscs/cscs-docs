# CSCS Code of Conduct

The CSCS code of conduct aims to outline the responsibilities and the proper practices for CSCS user community.

## Access to Source Code

If you are using your own code for production projects at CSCS, you agree to make this code available to CSCS application analysts for performance analysis and optimization purposes (if necessary).
If you are using third-party commercial or community open-source codes, CSCS will contact the developer as needed.

## Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC)

It is expressly stated that panel committee members must not be contacted under any circumstances on issues regarding proposals.
Violation of this rule disqualifies the proposal from scientific review and leads to immediate rejection of proposals.
