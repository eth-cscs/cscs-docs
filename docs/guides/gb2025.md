# Gordon Bell and HPL runs 2025

For Gordon Bell and HPL runs in March-April 2025, CSCS has expanded Santis to 1333 nodes (12 cabinets).

For the runs, CSCS has applied some updates and changes that aim to improve performance and scaling scale, particularly for NCCL.
If you are already familiar with running on Daint, you might have to make some small changes to your current job scripts and parameters, which will be documented here.

## Santis

### Connecting

Connecting to Santis via SSH is the same as for Daint and Clariden, see the [ssh guide][ref-ssh] for more information.

Add the following to your [SSH configuration][ref-ssh-config] to enable you to directly connect to Santis using `ssh santis`.
```
Host santis
    HostName santis.alps.cscs.ch
    ProxyJump ela
# change cscsusername to your CSCS username
    User cscsusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

### Reservations

The `normal` partition is used with no reservation, which means that that jobs can be submittied without `--partition` and `--reservation` flags.

Timeline:

1. Friday 4th April:
    * HPE finish HPL runs at 10:30am
    * CSCS performs testing on the reconfigured system for ~1 hour on the `GB_TESTING_2` reservation
    * The reservation is removed and all GB teams have access to test and tune applications.
2. Monday 7th April:
    * at 4pm the runs will start for the first team

!!! note
    There will be no special reservation during the open testing and tuning between Friday and Monday.

### Storage

Your data sets from Daint are available on Santis

* the same Home is shared between Daint, Clariden and Santis
* the same Scratch is mounted on both Santis and Daint
* Store/Project are also mounted.

## Low Noise Mode

!!! note
    Low noise mode has been disabled, so the previous requirement that you set `OMP_PLACES` and `OMP_PROC_BIND` no longer applies.

!!! warning "Unable to allocate resources: Requested node configuration is not available"
    If you try to use all 72 cores on each socket, SLURM will give a hard error, because only 71 are available:

    ```console
    # try to run 4 ranks per node, with 72 cores each
    $ srun -n4 -N1 -c72 ./build/affinity.mpi
    srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Requested node configuration is not available
    ```

### SLURM

Explicitly set the number of cores per task using the `--cpus-per-task/-c` flag, e.g.:
For example:
```
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=64
```
or
```
srun -N1 -n4 -c71 ...
```

## NCCL

!!! todo
    write a guide on which versions to use, environment variables to set, etc.
