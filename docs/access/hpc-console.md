# HPC Console

HPC Console is a web application that provides users with a modern web-based environment to interact with HPC resources such as clusters, job schedulers, and filesystems.

## Features


- Dashboard – shows cluster availability and basic system status.
- Jobs – allows creating, submitting, and monitoring jobs. Users can provide job name, script, and resource requirements.
