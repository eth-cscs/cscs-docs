# Alps Clusters

A vCluster (versatile software-defined cluster) is a logical partition of the supercomputing resources where platform services are deployed. It serves as a dedicated environment supporting a specific platform. The composition of resources and services for each vCluster is defined in a configuration file used by an automated pipeline for deployment. Once deployed by CSCS, the vCluster becomes immutable.
