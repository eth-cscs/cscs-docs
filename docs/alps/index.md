# Alps Infrastructure

Alps is a general-purpose compute and data Research Infrastructure (RI) open to the broad community of researchers in Switzerland and the rest of the world.
Alps provides a high impact, challenging and innovative RI that will allows Switzerland to advance science and impact society.

Alps enables the creation of versatile clusters (vClusters) that can be tailored to the specific needs of users while maintaining confidentiality.
For example, a vCluster will be dedicated to MeteoSwissâ€™ numerical weather forecasts, another one to the User Lab and another one to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

A key feature of Alps is multi-tenancy, where tenants are organizations, typically a research institution, that deploys, operates, or manages its platform on the Alps infrastructure.
Tenants have privileged access to resource nodes, enabling them to deploy their own services and resource configurations.
Additionally, network segregation ensures secure and isolated communication, with the option to connect to the tenant's private network.
