# Alps Storage

!!! todo
    Document the main storage hardware attached to Alps:

    * capstor
    * iopstor
    * vast

    The focus of these docs would be the basic details.

    The mounts, and how they are used for SCRATCH, STORE, PROJECT, HOME would be in the [storage docs](../storage/index.md)
