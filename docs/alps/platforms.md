# Platforms on Alps

A platform represents a set of scientific services along with compute and data resources hosted on the Alps research infrastructure, provided to a specific scientific community.
Each platform addresses particular research needs and domains, such as climate and weather modeling, machine learning, or high-performance computing applications.
A platform can consist of one or multiple [clusters][ref-alps-clusters], and its services can be managed either by CSCS or by the scientific community itself, including access control, usage policies, and support.
