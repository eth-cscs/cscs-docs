# Alps environments

Once you have logged into a [cluster][ref-alps-clusters] on Alps, you will want to set up your environment and find the software and tools provided by CSCS.
This part of the documentation will give guidance on how to set up your shell, and how to access software in uenv and container environments.

    CSCS provides two ways to access software, and create the environment used to develop and run.

    Scientific HPC workloads are a good fit for uenv -- a tool developed by CSCS to deliver scientific software stacks on Alps.

    The container engine runtime is recommended for machine learning workflows.
    It can also be a very good choice for Python environments installed using pip, uv and conda.

CSCS provides ready to use environments in uenv and containers:

* [Programming environments][ref-software-prgenvs];
* [Applications and software][ref-software].
