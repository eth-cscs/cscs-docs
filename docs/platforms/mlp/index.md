## Getting Started

### Getting access

Project administrators (PIs and deputy PIs) of projects on the MLp can to invite users to join their project, before they can use the project's resources on Alps.
This is performed using the [project managemant tool][waldur]

Once invited to a project, you will receive an email, which you can need to create an account and configure [multi-factor authentification][mfa] (MFA).

The main cluster provided by the MLp is Clariden, a large Grace-Hopper GPU system on Alps.
