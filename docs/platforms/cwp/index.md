# Climate and weather platform

The Climate and Weather Platform (CWP) provides compute, storage and support to the climate and weather modeling community in Switzerland.

## Getting Started

### Getting access

Project administrators (PIs and deputy PIs) of projects on the CWP can to invite users to join their project, before they can use the project's resources on Alps.

This is currently performed using the [project management tool][ref-account-ump].

Once invited to a project, you will receive an email, which you can need to create an account and configure [multi-factor authentication][ref-mfa] (MFA).

## Systems

Santis is the system deployed on the Alps infrastructure for the climate and weather platform.
Its name derives from the highest mountain SÃ¤ntis in the Alpstein massif of North-Eastern Switzerland.

    Santis is a large [Grace-Hopper][ref-alps-gh200-node] cluster.

## File systems and storage

There are three main file systems mounted on the CWP system Santis.

| type |mount | filesystem |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Home | /users/$USER | [VAST][ref-alps-vast] |
| Scratch | `/capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER` | [Capstor][ref-alps-capstor] |
| Project | `/capstor/store/cscs/userlab/<project>` | [Capstor][ref-alps-capstor] |

### Home

Every user has a home path (`$HOME`) mounted at `/users/$USER` on the [VAST][ref-alps-vast] filesystem.
The home directory has 50 GB of capacity, and is intended for configuration, small software packages and scripts.

### Scratch

The Scratch filesystem provides temporary storage for high-performance I/O for executing jobs.
Use scratch to store datasets that will be accessed by jobs, and for job output.
Scratch is per user - each user gets separate scratch path and quota.

!!! info
    A quota of 150 TB and 1 million inodes (files and folders) is applied to your scratch path.

    These are implemented as soft quotas: upon reaching either limit there is a grace period of 1 week before write access to `$SCRATCH` is blocked.

    You can check your quota at any time from Ela or one of the login nodes, using the [`quota` command][ref-storage-quota].

!!! info
    The environment variable `SCRATCH=/capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER` is set automatically when you log into the system, and can be used as a shortcut to access scratch.

!!! warning "scratch cleanup policy"
    Files that have not been accessed in 30 days are automatically deleted.

    **Scratch is not intended for permanent storage**: transfer files back to the capstor project storage after job runs.

### Project

Project storage is backed up, with no cleaning policy: it provides intermediate storage space for datasets, shared code or configuration scripts that need to be accessed from different vClusters.
Project is per project - each project gets a project folder with project-specific quota.

* hard limits on capacity and inodes prevent users from writing to project if the quota is reached - you can check quota and available space by running the [`quota`][ref-storage-quota] command on a login node or ela.
* it is not recommended to write directly to the project path from jobs.
